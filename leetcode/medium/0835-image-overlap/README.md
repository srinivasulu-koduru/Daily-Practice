# Image Overlap

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given two images, `img1` and `img2`, represented as binary, square matrices of size `n x n`. A binary matrix has only `0`s and `1`s as values.

We  **translate**  one image however we choose by sliding all the `1` bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the  **overlap**  by counting the number of positions that have a `1` in  **both**  images.

Note also that a translation does  **not**  include any kind of rotation. Any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.

Return  *the largest possible overlap*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We translate img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.

The number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3 (shown in red).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]]
Output: 1

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]]
Output: 0

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == img1.length == img1[i].length
- n == img2.length == img2[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 30
- img1[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
- img2[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

        int n = img1.length;
        List<int[]> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> list2 = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                if (img1[r][c] == 1) list1.add(new int[]{r, c});
                if (img2[r][c] == 1) list2.add(new int[]{r, c});
            }
        }

        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        int maxOverlap = 0;

        for (int[] p1 : list1) {
            for (int[] p2 : list2) {
                String shift = (p2[0] - p1[0]) + "," + (p2[1] - p1[1]);
                int current = count.getOrDefault(shift, 0) + 1;
                count.put(shift, current);
                maxOverlap = Math.max(maxOverlap, current);
            }
        }

        return maxOverlap;
    }
}
