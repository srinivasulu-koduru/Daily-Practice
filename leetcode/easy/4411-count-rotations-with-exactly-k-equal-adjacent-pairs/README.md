# Q1. Count Rotations With Exactly K Equal Adjacent Pairs

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

A  **cyclic rotation**  of `s` is obtained by choosing a  **prefix**  of `s` whose length is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), and moving it to the end of the string while preserving the order of all characters.

For  **every**  cyclic rotation of `s`, let its  **score**  be the number of indices `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1` and the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` are equal.

Return the number of cyclic rotations of `s` whose score equals `k`.

A  **prefix**  of a string is a substring that starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it.

A  **substring**  is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, which may be empty.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  s = "aab", k = 1

 **Output:**  2

 **Explanation:** 

The cyclic rotations of `s` are:

- "aab": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1.
- "aba": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
- "baa": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1.

Since `score` equals `k` for 2 cyclic rotations of `s`, the answer is 2.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  s = "abca", k = 0

 **Output:**  1

 **Explanation:** 

The cyclic rotations of `s` are:

- "abca": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
- "bcaa": The characters at positions 2 and 3 are equal, so score = 1.
- "caab": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1.
- "aabc": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1.

Since `score` equals `k` for only 1 cyclic rotation of `s`, the answer is 1.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= n == s.length <= 100
- s only consists of lowercase English letters.
- 0 <= k <= n - 1

            for(int j=0;j<s.length()-1;j++)
            {
                int c=s.charAt((i+j)%s.length());
                int n=s.charAt((i+j+1)%s.length());
                if(c==n) score++;
            }
            if(score==k) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
