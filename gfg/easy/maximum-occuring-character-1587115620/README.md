# Most Frequent Character

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s** of lowercase alphabets. The task is to find the maximum occurring character in the string  **s**. If more than one character occurs the maximum number of times then print the lexicographically smaller character.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "testsample"
Output: 'e'
Explanation: 'e' is the character which is having the highest frequency.
```

```
Input: s = "output"
Output: 't'
Explanation: 't' and 'u' are the characters with the same frequency, but 't' is lexicographically smaller.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100

```java
class Solution {
    public static char getMaxOccuringChar(String s) {
        // code here
        int freq[]=new int[26];
        for(char ch:s.toCharArray())
        {
            freq[ch-'a']++;
        }
        int max=-1;
        char r='a';
       for(int i=0;i<26;i++)
        {
            if(freq[i]>max)
            {
                max=freq[i];
                r=(char)(i+'a');
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
