## Problem

### Reach Weight

You need to buy some weights that total to exactly $N$ kg.

You can buy either $1$ kg weights for $20$ rupees, or $2$ kg weights for $30$ rupees.

Find the minimum cost to buy such a set of weights that sum to $N$ kg.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum total cost of buying a set of weights that total to exactly $N$ kg.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 100$

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t-->0)
	{
	    int n;
	    scanf("%d",&n);
	    int w=0;
	    while(n>=2)
	    {
	        w+=30;
	        n=n-2;
	    }
	    if(n==1)
	        w+=20;
	   printf("%d\n",w);
	}

}
